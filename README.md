# Meme Racing: An Entertaining Frame for Coin Racing and Betting

Meme Racing is an entertaining frame for coin racing and betting. To start playing, users should follow our profile and repost the Frame to participate. This engagement mechanism ensures a viral spread, inviting more participants to the game.

Upon entering, participants are presented with a choice of three memecoins. They place their bets using $DEGEN, predicting which memecoin will experience the most significant growth over the next ten minutes. 

The game operates in two main states: the betting collection phase, where users make their predictions and place their bets, and the race phase, where real-time market data dictates the performance of each memecoin in the race. 

Winners—those who bet on the memecoin with the highest growth—are then eligible to split the betting pool proportionally based on their share of the total bets placed on the winning coin. To get their rewards, winners should claim it directly from the frame ensuring decentralization and low gas fees. 

The project promises to deliver a unique blend of finance, gaming, and social networking, inviting users to experience the highs and lows of memecoin trading in a fun and interactive environment.
